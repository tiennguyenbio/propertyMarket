# Daily Dev Log — 2025-12-15

## What I did
- Modify the python scripts, get 20991 records from Auspost. The process took 4 hrs 26 min (16004.04 s).
- Clean the data, remove row with "category" = "Post Office Boxes". Obtained 16063 records. Created real estate website url.

## What I learned

### AUSPOST

- The needs of closing browsers and pages to avoid out of memories.

### REAL ESTATE

**The chart**
- The tooltip details show by clicking to the chart => Moving mouse function might needed. However it might not accurate. 

**House price guide**
- 5 year house price trend chart, each chart has some versions: buy/ rent/bedroom (2,3,4,all)

**Unit and apartment price guide**
- 5 year house price trend chart, each chart has some versions: buy/ rent/bedroom (1,2,3,all)

**Median price snapshot**
- buy/rent (table)

**Summary**

- 
## Problems / Bugs
- Out of memories. The script stop at around 9900/14755 url => Close the browser every 100 url and close the page every time.

## Next steps / Ideas
- Switch to the real estate website to get text data first.
