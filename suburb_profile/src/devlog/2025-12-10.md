# Daily Dev Log — 2025-12-10

## What I did
- Searched, selected, and downloaded suburbs data at multi-statistical-area-level from ABS.
- Created a github repo, sent invitation to Dat. He will helps restructure the repo. 
- Wrote first devlog.

## What I learned
- Postcodes are not static, they change over time. ABS defines 'postcode' is only for mail delivery. 
- The lastest postcode mapping by ABS was produced in 2011, which is outdated compared to the postcode we are using in 2025: https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/DetailsPage/1270.0.55.006July%202011?OpenDocument
- Australia Statistical Area Level (SA1-SA4) are geographic units used for census data, classified by size of population. In which, SA2 names represent suburbs or group of suburbs name.

## Problems / Bugs
- playwright newest version didn't work due to a requirements of OS 15. ==> Downgrade playwright to 1.23.0 make it work.
- playwright newest version generate errors related to nodejs version (16.13.0). ==> Checking current version, downgrade nodejs to 16.3.0. Nothing changed. 
- Mismatch between postcode/suburbs mapping between real estate website, AusPost, and ABS data. E.g. Checking on "Red Hill" suburbs of QLD showing: 9 postcodes in SA2_2011 (ABS), 2 postcodes in AusPost, 2 postcodes in real estate website. The postcodes numbers from AusPost and real estate website are the same. But the name of "postcodeData-head" from AusPost and "subheading" from real estate website do not match.

## Next steps / Ideas
- Get the suburb's names and postcodes data from AusPost or real estate website.
- Extract all text and numbers from a few suburb profiles. Notice: The time-series chart is important, if numbers are not available, collect image of chart".
