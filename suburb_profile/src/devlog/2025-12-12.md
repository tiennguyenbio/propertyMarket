## What I did
- Install Python 12.9 successfully.
- Get SVG file from the chart in suburb profile page of real estate website.

## What I learned
- "python --version" is not a great way to check for current python, it might show python 2 rather than python 3. "python3 --version" is the right way.
- The environment named "(base)" belongs to conda environment. I can turn off it by running "conda deactivate". Previously, "(base)" is activated, and it's python version is 3.11, that why the terminal showed 3.11 rather than 3.12.
- uv sync will install missing packages from dependencies (and remove packages which is not in the dependencies list). 

## Problems / Bugs
- Is it necessary to run "uv sync"?
- Terminal bash: "zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list. Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? ncompinit: initialization aborted complete:13: command not found: compdef"
- The postcodes downloaded from AusPost didn't include the information of "PO Box", so among the suburb and postcode, we have PO Box postcode.
- How to convert SVG file to IMG or meaningful data.
