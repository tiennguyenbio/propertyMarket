## What I did

- Get data from 99 pages from Domain and wait for the status 429 unblocked. 

- Wrote Python script to scrape data from 1 url, filter by Buy/Rent price, and Number of Bedrooms for Houses. Data includes: (1) median snapshot, (2) data values from the chart's tooltips (price per period over year), and (3) overall snapshot and summary. Export data as JSON.

## What I learned

- real estate provides more data than other competitors.

- real estate has a public API to request data (REA Partner Platform) 

- REA own flatmates.com

## Problems / Bugs

Status 429. White page show up. After getting the auspost url for the first time, I did tested hundreds url in high speed. I am not sure if I use playwright or just plain code. First the status was 200, then it was 429. 

## Next steps / Ideas

- Expand the Python script for "unit and apartment" as they have similar structure (number of bedrooms in unit and apartments are "all,1,2,3" while houses are "all,2,3,4".

- Wrote script to clean the collected data.

- Wrote script to scrape more page.
