## What I did
- Inspect the elements again. Find the pattern among different scenarios (page with 1 or more records, page with or without Details" => The data (including "Details") is belong to another elements, not the table: "div.resultsDetails.seoHideResults" , "div.location.suburb-map-results".
    
- Write new python script to get "Delivery" and "Details" using Playwright sync

## What I learned
- How to use Playwright locator.

## Problems / Bugs
- The script run very slow => Try: convert to "async" (not much improve), add time.sleep (0.05-0.3), saving data to a temporary list rather than a data frame. 
- The script failed to collect all data. Among 14775 url, about 2000 records was saved.

## Next steps / Ideas
- Modify the script to obtain all data.

## Notes / Code snippets

import time
start_time = time.time()
.../main script/
end_time = time.time()
elapse_time = end_time - start_time
